## 🚀 How to Test

### Quick Test Commands:

```bash
# Run permission tests
npm test -- permissions.test.js --watchAll=false

# Start development server
npm start
```

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. **Author Testing:**
   ```javascript
   // Expected behavior for author
   canCreateSections('author') // true
   canEditSections('author') // true
   canDeleteSections('author') // true
   canManageCollaborators('author') // true
   ```

2. **Collaborator Testing:**
   ```javascript
   // Expected behavior for collaborator
   canCreateSections('collaborator') // false
   canEditSections('collaborator') // true
   canDeleteSections('collaborator') // false
   canManageCollaborators('collaborator') // false
   ```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations:
1. **No Backend Integration**: Currently using localStorage for role storage
2. **No Real Authentication**: Using mock authentication system
3. **No Collaborator Management**: UI for managing collaborators not implemented yet

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Backend Integration**: Connect to real authentication system
2. **Collaborator Management**: Add UI for authors to manage collaborators
3. **Book-level Permissions**: Different permissions per book
4. **Audit Trail**: Track who made what changes

## 🎉 Implementation Complete!

The role-based permissions system is fully implemented and tested. Users can now:

1. **Register with specific roles** (Author/Collaborator)
2. **See their role displayed** in the UI
3. **Have appropriate permissions** enforced throughout the app
4. **Receive clear feedback** when trying unauthorized actions
5. **Test the system** using the built-in role test component

The implementation follows best practices:
- ✅ Separation of concerns
- ✅ Reusable utility functions
- ✅ Comprehensive testing
- ✅ Clear user feedback
- ✅ Scalable permission matrix
